# PICO-STACK

> Pico stack is a WEB3.0 framework

It allows you to build Progressive Web Apps that work completely without a server/backend/REST-API and without a central database.

> When you stash your entire Backend inside Frontend you get "Blockend".

I want to document and consolidate these components into a single easy to use module.

```js
import { Feed, Modem56, PicoStore } from 'picostack'
```

But for now (if you have the guts), refer to [PicoChat](https://github.com/telamon/picochat/) source, it serves as reference for this technology.


## core components

- [picofeed](https://github.com/telamon/picofeed) Ultra-portable secure feed/chain-of-blocks
- [picorepo](https://github.com/telamon/picorepo) Lightweight persistent block store ontop of leveldb/leveljs.
- [picostore](https://github.com/telamon/picostore) Redux-like state machine.
- [piconet](https://github.com/telamon/piconet) Internet Protocol redesigned for P2P, provides a stateless and easy to use alternative to network streams.
- [Modem56](https://github.com/telamon/picochat/blob/master/modem56.js) hyperswarm wrapper providing pico-net streams instead of sockets.
- [nuro](https://github.com/telamon/picochat/blob/master/blockend/nuro.js) A pure functional approach to reactive store pattern, desig reactive neural pathways framework agnostic.
