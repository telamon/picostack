This is a toolkit to build P2P application cores, using _emepheral_ states.  

Why do we need yet another consensus engine in 202x?  
Well this one provides a non-token based approach to decentralization _(and also it runs in frontend/-user device with finite resources)_.  

**The General Idea**  
In a picoverse nothing is permanent, blocks dissapear, chains corrupt,
states across nodes differ.  
The global state exists but is considered "non computable", so each node attempts to gather and forward as many valid block sequences as it can hold, discarding lesser along the way.  
In bc-terms pico could be called an intricate mempool that gives you fine control over computing states that "could be".


This kit exposes a higher level API to quickly design and test what ever consensus
you imagine.  
If you stumble on a local state that you wish to persist as truth, you can of course 
copy the pico-blocks to what ever medium you like.  
Their format is binary and _quite_ space-efficient.


**Update 2024**
After _a lot_ of iterations picostore 3.x is starting to emerge.  
In hindsight I would have liked to rename some components like `stack => core-kit` and `store => block-engine`,
it makes more sense.


### [[live demo]](https://pico-todo.surge.sh/)

## core components

- [picofeed](https://github.com/telamon/picofeed) Ultra-portable secure feed/chain-of-blocks
- [picostore](https://github.com/telamon/picostore) block engine w/ garbarge collector.
- [piconet](https://github.com/telamon/piconet) Internet Protocol redesigned for P2P, provides a stateless and easy to use alternative to network streams.
- [Modem56](https://github.com/telamon/picochat/blob/master/modem56.js) hyperswarm to pico-net converter.
- [nuro](https://github.com/telamon/piconuro) A pure functional approach to reactive store pattern, design your own reactive neural pathways, completely framework agnostic.
- [HyperSimulator](https://github.com/telamon/hyper-simulator) Run dat/[hyper](https://hypercore-protocol.org/)-apps in an in-memory swarm and watch the chaos unfold.
- [picorepo](https://github.com/telamon/picorepo) Lightweight persistent block store ontop of leveldb/leveljs.

## Quickstart

Use the [project template](https://github.com/telamon/pico-template):

```bash
npx degit telamon/pico-template my-project
```

Check the `README.md` in the generated folder.

## usage

Extend [`SimpleKernel`](./simple-kernel.js) when starting new.

```js
// blockend.js
import { SimpleKernel } from 'picostack'
const { decodeBlock } = SimpleKernel

class Kernel extends SimpleKernel {
  constructor(db) {
    super(db)

    // Register reducer - see picostore docs
    this.store.register({
      name: 'clock', // slice name
      initialValue: 0, // initial state
      filter ({ block }) { // network-consensus
        const { type, time } = decodeBlock(block.body)
        if (type !== 'tick') return true // silent ignore
        if (time > Date.now()) return 'TimestampFromFuture'
      },
      reducer ({ block }) { // mutate state
        const { time } = decodeBlock(block.body)
        return time
      }
    })
  }

  // Create action
  async createTick () {
    const feed = await this.createBlock(
      'tick', // BlockType:string
      { time: Date.now() } // Payload:any
    )
    return feed.last.sig // block-id
  }
}

async function main() {
  // Spawn 2 peers
  const alice = new Kernel(memdown())
  await alice.boot()

  const bob = new Kernel(memdown())
  await bob.boot()

  // Attach state-observers
  alice.store.on('clock', state => console.log('Alice:', state))
  bob.store.on('clock', state => console.log('Bob:', state))

  // Wire up
  alice.spawnWire()(bob.spawnWire())

  await alice.createTick()
  // Both kernels logs new state
}
main().catch(console.error)
```

## ZEN.md

Word of advice to the brave, this code was written mainly during tired off-hours,
it is intristically minimalistic and mostly dependency free.

Best code, no code:

- standard - no semis
- spaces until tabs.
- Uint8Array > Buffer
- JSDoc types on plebic APIs

That's it.. sorry.
